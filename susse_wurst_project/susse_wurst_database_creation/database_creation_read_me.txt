Süsse Wurst Database Creation

1. The database creation script is the complete program for implementing the Süsse Wurst database using MySQL, 
including all data inserts, views, stored functions and procedures.

2. (Optional) The database system can also be implemented piecemeal using the creation without inserts script,
the separate scripts for view and stored routines, and the data insert script.

3. The CSV files hold all the data to eventually be loaded into the finished database. The python_create_inserts.py
program when run will read each CSV file to create a single SQL insert script.
