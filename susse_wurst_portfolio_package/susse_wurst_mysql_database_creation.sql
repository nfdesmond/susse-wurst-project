SÜSSE WURST DATABASE SYSTEM CREATION FOR MYSQL

DEVELOPER: N.F. Desmond
DATE: November 2025
DESCRIPTION: This script implmenents a complete MySQL database for the Süsse Wurst
grocery store project. The overall system consists of two connected database schemas:
  1. sw_hr - Human Resources database
  2. sw_store - Store Inventory and Supply database
Each schema includes data inserts for all tables along with views, stored procedures, and 
stored functions as required.
*******************************************************************************************/

/*********** I. DROP EXISTING DATABASES ***********/

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sw_hr;
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sw_store;


/*********** II. CREATE HR AND STORE DATABASES ***********/

CREATE DATABASE sw_hr

CREATE DATABASE sw_store
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_as_ci;
-- the collation for sw_store is accent-sensitive to account for the
