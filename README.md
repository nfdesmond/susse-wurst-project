# susse-wurst-project
Süsse Wurst is a high-end grocery store chain offering imported goods from Central Europe with an emphasis on German products. With multiple locations in Arizona and a new store recently opened in Henderson, Nevada, Süsse Wurst aims to be the premier destination for European foods and spirits in the southwest!

The code and scripts in this repository will build the database used for managing Süsse Wurst on a MySQL database. Python has been used to auto-generate addresses for employees, and to also create simple GUI interfaces using TKinter to demonstrate how a front-end user might access the database through a client application.
